# Intro
<p>Wander was designed by people who have a love for culture and travel.
When you embark on an adventure, you meet incredible people,
see amazing sights, eat great food, and pause where ever you can to
capture that memory with a photo.</p>

<p>Wander will take the photographs of your journey and and map out
where they were taken. Wander will then place them by location over a google
maps image and create a route based on your photos, so you'll know exactly
where the photos were taken and the route you took.</p>

# NEXT STEPS

In our icebox we have several ideas to improve the existing app. Those ideas include:

- 1) Sorting users trips by location

- 2) Chat with other users

- 3) Leave comments of other users trips

- 4) Implement some sort of Heat Map that would show different colors for locations with a greater density of pictures

- 5) Incorporate fusion table queries
